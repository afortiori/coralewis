        <p class="text">I really enjoyed the start of this course. Though a lot of the illustrator introduction was review and felt a bit too easy. So far, I've also really enjoyed reading the design book and the topics the book has covered. The book is very beautiful inside. However, during the formstorming project,&nbsp; I felt very rushed on the illustrator portion even though I came outside of class to work on it. That was difficult because I felt the work I turned in was far from my best work. Still, I'm proud of my physical designs themselves. I'm excited about the physical to digital, and I am very glad we will have extra time to work on it. I'm not too satisfied with how it's turning out so far, but I know this class is all about learning, so as the year progresses I hope to get better.&nbsp;</p>
