        <h5> Photoshop Poster Reflection </h5>
        <p class="date"> 2-6-20</p>
        <p class="text">
         I really liked this project because it challenged me. Though the zine project was my favorite, that didn’t challenge me as much as this project. It was very hard to come up with my movie idea. I did pages and pages of sketches. I took a lot more time with the ideation than my first poster which I kinda just dumped onto the page. Also, I spent a lot longer on getting the “photoshopping” correct even though I still see errors that I want to fix. I also feel like my ability to understand good/bad design and execute good design has improved a lot. My previous poster was visually confusing while I feel like this poster was more clear and easier to understand.  Coach Hall’s feedback really made my poster a lot better and I learned a lot from it.

        <p class="text">
          I believe I had a different experience from others during the lunchtime lecture because I have already finalized my college list. This in and of itself has been a huge challenge because for the last 5 years I have been pretty sure about what I want to do or more exactly the things I want to do. However, more recently I've been unsure, which makes me very glad to have applied to many liberal arts colleges where knowing what I want to do is not important. For these reasons, I didn't think at all going into the presentation that I would go to art school. However, taking a look at something so different was very interesting.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I found it very interesting that majors like illustration and graphic design are looked down upon. I understand that they seem more "corporate" but I also feel that in such a cut-throat world, picking a major that will help you survive in our society and not struggle to make ends meet should not be looked down upon. Additionally, when we look at modernism and other design movements, I can see that graphic design truly shouldn't be looked down upon.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Another interesting thing was the many descriptions of demotivated students. This made me sad because as I've looked at colleges I've really wanted to find a college where students take the learning outside of the classroom and are dedicated to "intellectual" pursuits. These descriptions of privilege and demotivation were really depressing because I assume they extend outside art school.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          It made me very sad when students talked about how artwork about minorities is also misunderstood. A slight diversion: My dad and I were once selling my mom's art at a convention and a lot of people didn't understand it because it was about niche topics and just walked on by. When people did understand it, you could just see on their face how happy they were. This really made me think because my mom's work doesn't have to do with identity, but because I've seen this dynamic I can only imagine how multiplied this problem and the pain associated with it is when an artist makes art about their own identity, not just niche topics.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          So far my reflection has been a bit negative, so I'll end on a happy note. I was so impressed to see so many people following their passions. Creativity is one of the things I value the most and it was incredible to see everyone's passions. Thanks so much for doing this!

          The map that was available online does not provide much information about the collection. The maps only show the basic shape of the museum and the types of spaces. No clues for what type of museum are given except for the unorthodox shape and statue gardens which show it’s an art museum. The labels are vague and broad so it would be impossible to locate a work of art based on these maps alone. Still, the map is very simple so people who are visually impaired should have no problem understanding it.  I hope that the in-person maps have much more detail. This maps may seem like terrible design, but I believe that their purpose is not for the average visitor who would get a real map when they visited but a wealthy company or individual who are looking for a space to rent and are most interested in space and size of the museum. In that context, the maps succeed. The font is sans-serif.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          The function of this design is to show the name of the museum and express what the museum is about. The abstract/modern art and the curved title (which demonstrates the shape of the museum)  does this perfectly, though I would prefer that the entire work of artwork would appear on the screen. The label of the artwork which is at the bottom left only appears when you scroll down and though the label is clear, I would like the label to appear as soon as you load the page without any scrolling. The fonts are consistent with the map.

          The exhibition page’s function is to show what the current exhibitions are. The design does this in a clear and visually appealing way. The exhibitions shown show a good example of what type of works are at this museum (works that are abstract and modern).  The fonts are consistent with the map and other parts of the webpage. The works are copped but you can see enough of them to not be confused and the labels below are descriptive.

          This is the join and give page which is meant to give information about donating and getting a membership. However, the design is very poor because there is no title and information available when you click. There is only an image that though shows that the Hirshhorn is an important museum, fails to give information on donating or getting a membership. The fonts are consistent though. The artwork here is not labeled nor is what gallery this is labeled. The image itself doesn’t fully appear when loaded.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/bag.png"> </img>
        <p class="text">
          I choose this work of art because it is something that I may actually buy because I feel like it represents a very important part of American art history. The designer had to copy Andy Warhol’s print and then create a bag that matched his design.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/bowl.png"> </img>
        <p class="text">
          I choose this design because I feel like it is very practical and can be used very well. To make this, the designer had to be inspired by the Hirshhorn collection in order to make sure the work fitted in with the other works in the gift store and didn’t seem like just a random bowl.

          This map is very confusing and impossible to read. I have 20 20 vision and I cannot understand it so I have no doubt that people who are visually impaired will have an even harder time. It is even worse that to properly understand where everything is you need to use the color guide so it is inaccessible to people who have color blindness. There is simply too much information in too small of a space. Still, if I look closely I can decipher where a work of art is based on what type of art it is. Besides showing the berth of what types of art are here, very little about the mood or vibe of the museum is communicated.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/mainnat.png"> </img>
        <p class="text">
          The goal of this page is to introduce the museum to the viewers. Though navigation, name, and basic information are clearly given. There is little about what type of museum it is. The design is very simple and does not reveal much about what type of museum it is though the museum could be seen as being traditional. The font is not consistent with the map at all. Here there are both sans-serif and serif. All fonts are legible.  The work of art is not cropped or labeled and it is very hard to tell what you are looking at besides it being a statue.
        </p>

          This part of the webpage communicates what the museum has to offer. It does this very well by having well-written titles, descriptions and well-chosen images. The fonts are consistent with the main page. The design is simple and formal, which though doesn’t tell much about the museum it does show how traditional this museum is. The work of art shown is cropped, but it is clearly labeled and it is clear about what is being shown.

          This page’s goal is to show a bit more about what this museum is about. The design doesn’t communicate much about the “style” of this museum expect perhaps a formal nature. However, the picture of the work do show the diversity of the museum’s collection.  The use of whitespace cuts off the titles and bottom parts of the museum which isn’t very good at all. (None of the images are actually cropped though.)  The fonts are consistent with the other pages of the web site.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/orn.png"> </img>
        <p class="text">
          I chose this because I liked how it represented Monet’s work and I may actually buy it if I had the chance and the money. The designer had to pick a representative work of Monet’s, crop it, and pick an ornament type that best fits the selection.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/ear.png"> </img>
        <p class="text">
          I chose this because I was curious about what jewelry the NGA was selling and this was one of my favorites. The designer had to look at the Asian art the NGA had in order to create a design that was accurately inspired and representative of that collection.

        <h5> First Quarter Blog Post</h5>
        <p class="date"> 11-01-19</p>
        <p class="text">I really enjoyed the start of this course. Though a lot of the illustrator introduction was review and felt a bit too easy. So far, I've also really enjoyed reading the design book and the topics the book has covered. The book is very beautiful inside. However, during the formstorming project,&nbsp; I felt very rushed on the illustrator portion even though I came outside of class to work on it. That was difficult because I felt the work I turned in was far from my best work. Still, I'm proud of my physical designs themselves. I'm excited about the physical to digital, and I am very glad we will have extra time to work on it. I'm not too satisfied with how it's turning out so far, but I know this class is all about learning, so as the year progresses I hope to get better.&nbsp;</p>
